# More Widgets

This chapter carries on introducing several more widgets: listbox, scrollbar,
text, scale, spinbox, and progressbar. Some of these are starting to be a bit
more powerful than the basic ones we looked at before. Here we'll also see a few
instances of using the classic Tk widgets, in cases where there isn't (or there
isn't a need for) a themed counterpart.
